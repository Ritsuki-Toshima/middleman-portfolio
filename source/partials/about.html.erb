          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>Hello, world! I'm a full-stack web developer in Japan! I was born in Aichi in 1997. Hello, I'm Ritsuo, but most people call me Ricky. I'm originally from Aichi prefecture, Japan, and currently, I call Nagoya my home.
            After graduating from university, I embarked on a unique career path. I spent three years as an English teacher at a high school, helping students learn the intricacies of the language. However, my passion for technology and coding led me to make a bold career change.
            I took a leap of faith and left my teaching job to pursue a career in the IT industry. To prepare myself for this exciting transition, I joined Le Wagon, a renowned coding bootcamp located in Tokyo. It was an intensive and rewarding experience that opened up a world of opportunities.
