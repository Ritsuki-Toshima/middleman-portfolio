          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>Hello, world! I'm <strong>Ritsuki</strong> and I'm from <strong>🇯🇵Aichi, Japan</strong>.
            I'm always enthusiastic, I'm also creative and love helping people by solving their problems.
            <br>
            <br>
            After I graduated from university, I worked as an English teacher for three years, but I decided to make a career change to become a full-stack developer and joined in a coding bootcamp called <strong>🗼Le Wagon Tokyo</strong>(9-week intensive coding program).
            Teaching had its rewards, but I realized that I could help more people by using the power of technology.
            <br>
            <br>
            Now, my goal is to become a programmer who can write code that empathetically caters to each user's needs. I'm excited about the possibilities ahead and
            how technology can enable me to make a difference in people's lives on a larger scale.
