          <h2>About me</h2>
          I am a <strong>full-stack web developer💻</strong> I was born and raised in Aichi, <strong>Japan🇯🇵</strong>
          I'm always enthusiastic and also creative and love helping people by solving their problems.
          <br>
          <br>
          After I graduated from university, I worked as an English teacher for three years, but I decided to make a career change to become a full-stack web developer
          and joined in a coding bootcamp called <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/" style="text-decoration: none; color: black;", target="_blank"><strong>Le Wagon Tokyo🗼</strong></a>(9-week intensive coding program).
          Teaching had its rewards, but I realized that I could help more people by using the power of technology.
          <br>
          <br>
          Now, my goal is to become a programmer who can write code that empathetically caters to each user's needs. I'm excited about the possibilities ahead and
          how technology can enable me to make a difference in people's lives on a larger scale🌎
